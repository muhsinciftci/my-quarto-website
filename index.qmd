**Hello!**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt School of Economics. My research interests lie within the intersection of economics of climate change and macro-econometrics. I further analyze the textual data using machine learning techniques and combine it with macro-econometric models in my research.

Before joining Goethe University Frankfurt, I received a Master of Science in Economics from Middle East Technical University, and at the same time, I worked as a researcher at the research and monetary policy department of the Central Bank of Turkey.
