My research interests lie within the intersection of international macroeconomics, climate change, and applied econometrics. I further analyze the textual data using machine learning techniques and combine it with conventional macroeconometric models in my research.\nBefore joining Goethe University Frankfurt, I received a Master of Science in Economics from Middle East Technical University, and at the same time, I worked as a researcher at the Central Bank of Turkey. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Bogazici University.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Macroeconomics\nApplied Econometrics\nAnalysis of Textual Data\n\n\n\n\n\n Ph.D. in Economics, Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany | 2019 - Present\n M.Sc. in Economics, Middle East Technical University, Turkey | 2017 - 2019\n B.A. in Economics, Bogazici University, Turkey | 2010 - 2015"
