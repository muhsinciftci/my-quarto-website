	abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, we study the impact of market share on exchange rate pass-through to Turkish manufacturing sector prices using four-digit industry level disaggregate data. Our findings provide evidence that exchange rate pass-through in the manufacturing sector has an asymmetric U-shape with respect to market share, implying that highly competitive and concentrated industries pass-through exchange rate movements in both directions (appreciation and depreciation) to local producer prices more than moderately concentrated sectors. However, when directional asymmetries of exchange rate movements are added to the models, results become more revealing, that is, highly monopolized industries pass-through exchange rate depreciation at higher rates than highly competitive industries. We also find that the size of the exchange rate movement has an impact on the asymmetry and the curvature of the U-shaped Exchange Rate Pass-Through (ERPT) curve with respect to the market share.},

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a small open economy, inflation is still largely driven by exchange rate developments in Turkey. Despite the fact that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to inflation has declined after the adoption of explicit inflation targeting in 2003, its contribution to the consumer prices and producer prices inflation is still prominent. Furthermore, recent studies show that inflation persistence appears to be another issue preventing from achieving price stability. This paper aims to explore the non-linear dynamics of ERPT and inflation persistence in the case of Turkey by employing Smooth Transition Regression (STR) models. The main motivation of this study is to identify different regimes characterized by the magnitude of exchange rate movements in which ERPT and persistence in inflation indicators differ. Estimation results for the period 2003-2017 shows that inflation persistence and ERPT for Consumer Price Index (CPI) is high in regime with a sizeable import price shock. Additionally, STR estimation results indicate that ERPT and import price pass-through to Producer Price Index (PPI) is more influential in “high depreciation” regime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={1},
